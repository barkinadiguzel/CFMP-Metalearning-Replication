# CFMP-Metalearning-Replication
CFMP-Metalearning-Replication is a research-oriented implementation that directly translates the mathematical formulation and architecture of the proposed meta-learning molecular property prediction model into code. The focus is on faithfully reproducing the paper’s theoretical design rather than optimizing for production use.
